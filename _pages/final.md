## Final Project

The final project invites students to expand on one or more aspects of the course in greater depth. There are three suggested formats / conceptual frameworks that I encourage you to explore for your final project:
- **MIRROR**: create an interactive experience that reflects something back to the user. This shouldn’t behave as a typical visual mirror, but should modify the user’s image or gesture into an unexpected output.
- **INSTRUMENT**: expanding on the instrumentation exercises from class, create an instrument that transforms a gesture into some form of audio/visual expression. This does not have to be a typical musical instrument. Experimentation with different generative and interactive possibilities is encouraged!
- **CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE**: create an interactive narrative that invites the user to make choices that influence their journey. This narrative should make use of dynamic user input and should include sound and visual forms.
Students are also encouraged to bring their own formats and ideas to the table – I am open to all kinds of project ideas, so long as they demonstrate several technical approaches from the course and are feasible within the given time frame. Students will be asked to turn in a project proposal mid-semester that outlines their ideas for the final project.
