## Assignment 5: Projection Mapping Workshop

Create a series of three “mini-sketches” that produce some kind of animation. Using  lerp(), noise(), sin() or cos(), random(), incrementation operators or other animation methods to create three sketches that are variations of a similar visual concept. This is a creatively open assignment, though my suggestion is to keep things as simple as possible, as you will be integrating these mini-sketches in a projection-mapped installation on October 29th.

You should experiment with color, form and motion in your mini-sketches. Halloween is next week, so you are welcome to include halloween themes in this work!

Please use the following specifications:
- The canvas size should be 400 by 400
- Any variables you use should be uniquely named: don’t use x or y, instead use craigX or bananaY (something unique to your specific visualization). This will ensure that different projects that we combine don’t have any clashing variable names.
- Your animation should run without user interaction (rather than moving things using the mouse, use an incremented variable, or the frame count, to propel the animated elements)
- Avoid using classes for this assignment

Your grade for this assignment will be half derived from the creative aspects of your mini-sketches (which you will submit via Brightspace), and half derived from your participation in the October 29th projection mapping workshop.


**Creative**: /5
- You have experimented with color, form and motion to create a series of thematically-linked mini sketches.
- The sketches reflect artistic intention and creative experimentation

**Participation/Technical**: /5
- The sketches conform to the technical specifications of the assignment
- The student has meaningfully experimented with projection mapping techniques in the workshop

Mini sketches are due Wednesday, October 29th at 1pm. You will be implementing these sketches in a collaborative workshop during class that day, so on-site participation is required!
