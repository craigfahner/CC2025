## Assignment 1: Geometric Abstraction

Choose a geometric abstraction painting from [this link](https://artsandculture.google.com/entity/geometric-abstraction/m05bw0l)

Make sure the painting you select has multiple shapes and colors.

Reproduce the painting using p5.js shape functions. 

Using color variables, create a variation on the original color composition.

Your sketch must contain:
- At least 3 different shape functions *including the beginShape(), vertex() and endShape() functions*
- The use of variables
- A creative reinterpretation of the original artwork using a different color palette
- For 100% technical grade: make your painting SCALABLE - using [width](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/width) and [height](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/height) variables and expressions, create an interpretation of the painting that scales with different window sizes (using [windowWidth](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/windowWidth) and [windowHeight](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/windowWidth) to set the canvas size).

**Evaluation:**
*Creative*:
- 0 points: the sketch does not alter the color of the original painting. You have not selected a challenging or suitably complex source image.
- 2.5 points: the sketch alters the color of the original painting, but not in a way that considers the aesthetic unity of the original
- 5 points: the sketch alters the color of the original painting and does so in a way that reflects complementary colors and aesthetic unity_


*Technical*:

- 0 points: the sketch does not accurately reproduce the composition of the original painting
- 2.5 points: the sketch reproduces the composition of the original painting using multiple shape functions and color variables
- 5 points: the sketch reproduces the composition of the original painting, and is dynamically scalable using math expressions and width and height variables
