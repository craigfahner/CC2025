## Assignment 3: Abstract Clock

Create a sketch that responds to time. Using p5's time-related functions, make an abstract clock that changes as time passes. Use at least three of the following functions to represent three sub-divisions of time:

-   [day()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/day)
-   [hour()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/hour)
-   [minute()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/minute)
-   [millis()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/millis)
-   [month()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/month)
-   [second()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/second)
-   [year()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/year)

Your clock can keep track of typical increments of time (hours, minutes and seconds) or longer periods of time like days, weeks, months and years. Crucially, your clock *should not look like a typical clock*. What other ways can we conceive of keeping track of time that don't resemble a standard digital or analog clock? Your clock doesn't need to be conventionally "readable" but should present the passage of time through creative expression. How can you convey time in terms of its personal significance? How can time be conveyed in a less structured, more expressive way? What aspects of time's passing can be represented through p5 (the sun and moon rising, for instance, or periods of sleep, wakefulness, peace and chaos)? Consider these questions and come up with a concept by making sketches first on paper or in a digital drawing program, then translate your prototypes into code. Describe your process in your readme file.

Here are some examples of abstract clocks created using p5.js and other web-based coding tools:

 - [Golan Levin's Banded Clock   (1999)](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/503941/)
 - [Eliza Pratt's Coded Clocks](https://elizapratt.myportfolio.com/abstractclock)
 - [Tageszeituhr by Benedikt Hassert](https://tageszeituhr.benedikthassert.com/)
 - [The Colour Clock](http://thecolourclock.com/)
 - [PolarClock](https://mbostock.github.io/protovis/ex/clock.html)
 - [The Clock of the Long Now](https://longnow.org/clock/)

Evaluation criteria:

Creative: Your sketch should be a novel representation of time that differs from the above examples, and does not represent a typical analog or digital clock. Full points will be awarded to projects that engage with the prompt in a way that conveys a particular concept in relation to the passage of time. Partial points will be awarded to projects that engage creatively with the prompt, but do not convey a particular concept or message. Zero points will be awarded to projects that resemble typical analog clocks or existing projects.

Technical: Your sketch should make use of at least three of the time-related functions listed above. It should render shapes to the canvas using at least three methods. It should include at least one for loop OR at least one conditional statement. It should be responsive to changes in time. *Your code should be commented extensively throughout. Each section of code should be commented to explain what the code is accomplishing in your sketch. Failure to comment properly will result in a maximum technical grade of 3/5.*

Due Wednesday, October 15th at 1pm. **An in-progress version is due October 8th, which should have the following elements completed:**
- The visual elements of your abstract clock should be in place
- The concept of how time will be mapped to a visual form should be established and described in the comments, even if it is not fully implemented yet
