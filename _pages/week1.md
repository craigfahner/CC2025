### Getting set up with VSCode, GitHub and GitHub Pages

**GitHub**

GitHub provides the infrastructure for this course. It is how I will share assignments and examples with you, and it is how you will submit your own notes and assignments. It also allows you to publish your content to the web easily through something called GitHub Pages.

1. Sign up for a new [GitHub](https://github.com) account. If you already have one, you can either use your existing account or sign up for a new, course-specific account. ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVRuPO8nCLA)).
2. Download and install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5A0kDdCwk)).
3. Log into your new GitHub account from GitHub desktop.

**VSCode**

VSCode is the code editor we will be using in this class. It is essentially a fancy text editor that is streamlined for editing code. While you can technically edit code in any basic text editor, VSCode is nice because it can auto-format your code, it color-codes different elements of your code, and you can preview what you're working on in the editor.

1. [Download VSCode here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install VSCode
3. Open VSCode and install these three extensions
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
- [p5js Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acidic9.p5js-snippets)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

The easiest way to install extensions is to click on the extension icon in the code editor, and to search for the extensions by name, after which you can click the "install" button. ([video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bwj703QNU9L762EmWsm-hQ_Cl-vl6Nov/view?usp=sharing))

**Creating a course repo**

Everything you do in this course will be contained in one folder. A **GitHub Repository** or "repo" is a folder that you can synchronize to a server. This serves as a version control mechanism, a storage/backup solution, and a method to share and publish your work. I've shared a template repository that has everything you need in it to get started writing code in p5.js. You can create a new repository from the template using the following steps:

1. Go to this link: https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-A/CC-template/
2. Hit the template button: ![Use this template]({{ "/assets/template.png" | relative_url }})
3.
