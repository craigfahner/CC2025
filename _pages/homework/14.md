    ## Review:
    Our final project is an opportunity to combine everything that we've learned so far to create a piece of work that showcases not only our technical knowledge, but also our design skills, and ability to think critically while making connections between our readings and our practice.

    For full credit projects should have a physical-computing aspect, and an audio or visual aspect, so this means using both an Arduino for input or output, together with a p5js sketch. Projects also have to have custom functions, arrays, objects or classes, `for()` loops and `if()` statements, and demonstrate forethought and planning. At the same time, we're expected to go beyond the basic concepts of programming, so use of external libraries is extremely encouraged.

    ## This Milestone: Final Code, Documentation and Video

    ### Code
    For this week's milestone you will finish the code to fully bring your idea into practice.

    Your repository should have your arduino code and your p5js code.

    ### Documentation
    Your repository should have a README with the following information:
    - System diagram
    - FSM diagram
    - Circuit diagram
    - Description of any external data or library that you are planning to use
    - Description of any sensor, output component or mechanism that you are planning on using or building
    - Reference images, texts and projects
    - Short discussion of why your project is relevant:
      - how is it related to our readings?
      - how does it connected to society?
      - why is it important to you?
    - Short discussion of feedback from user testing

    Even if these were included in a previous milestone, include a copy or updated version under one cohesive "final" writeup section in your README.

    ### Video
    Make a shorty video where you talk about the project and show it working. Make sure to show the circuit,the interactions and the p5js component. Ask a friend for help to make sure the video shows everything while you talk a little bit about the project. You can do this in class during/after presenting the project.

    ## Class presentation
    Bring your project to class on 2024/12/16.

    We will do a round-table of project presentations and get some feedback from each other. This is not formal and we will not need slides or anything.

    ## Submission and Grading
    Please submit a video of your project and a link to your project repository via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563).

    You have until 5PM on Tuesday, December 17th to submit a link.

    The following guide will be used for grading:

    | Task | Points |
    | --- | --- |
    | Documentation | 3 points |
    | Video | 3 points |
    | Participation | 3 points |
    | Project is compliant | 3 points |
    | Project is ex-pressive | 3 points |
    | Project is in-pressive | 3 points |

    Documentation: project has a healthy README with weekly updates, sketches, images, references and progress reports, AND all of the elements specified above under the Documentation section.

    Video: video shows the different uses, situations and interactions for the project, and clearly shows the circuit and any audio or visual outputs.

    Participation: presented and gave feedback during the class round-table sessions.

    Compliant: project followed the requirements: it's interactive, uses arduino and p5js, includes custom functions, arrays, objects or classes, `for()` loops and `if()` statements... etc.

    Ex-pressive: project demonstrates your personality. It makes connections between course content, the rest of the world and your own interests as an artist, designer, technologist. 

    In-pressive: project was challenging, demonstrates growth and shows mastery of programming concepts.
