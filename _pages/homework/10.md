    ### Intro:

    This assignment is an opportunity to practice with sounds and visualizations.

    ---
    ### Getting Started and Submitting:

    You can start by cloning our [multi-sketch template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/p5js-multi-sketch-template) into a repository called `HW10`.

    Since the computer is gonna be doing all the work of filling our screen, please use: `createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight)`.

    Like previous assignments, please [enable GitHub pages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqjPr7auwdY) on your GitHub repos and use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563) to submit GitHub links to your HW10 repository.

    ---
    ### Evaluation
    This assignment will be graded on a scale from 0 to 10, taking the following criteria into account:

    - README: repository includes a `README.md` file with information about the process.
    - Compliance: work follows the requirements specified in the assignment description.
    - Implementation: work shows evidence of understanding programming concepts and you are fully using them to express your ideas.
    - Thoughtfulness: project demonstrates your personality and it’s not a straightforward re-implementation of someone else’s idea.
    - Craft: code and results show care and consideration for presentation and professionalism, and work doesn’t look like it was rushed.

    ### HW10A

    ### Visualizing Live Sound

    In this exercise we will use the [p5 sound library](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/libraries/p5.sound) to create a LIVE visualization for a song.

    Pick a song, any song. Feel free to create a song or use something that already exists. It should be about $$1$$ minute long. If using something that is longer, please edit it down to one minute.

    Include the p5 sound library in the project, following the instructions on the [sound tutorial](https://idmp5.github.io/creative-coding/sound-files/) or the [code from class](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/WK10).

    You can use this URL for the sound library:
    ```js
    https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.7.0/lib/addons/p5.sound.js
    ```

    Load the song into your sketch, set it up so it plays automatically or on a mouse click, and then use [`p5.Amplitude`](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5.Amplitude) and [`p5.FFT`](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5.FFT) objects to get volume and frequency information from the audio being played.

    Once you have volume and frequency information from the live samples being played, use them to create patterns, drawings, movements, anything, on the canvas.

    Since we want this to be dope!, make the canvas as big as the browser window:
    ```js
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
    ```

    You don't have to visualize $$1000$$ frequencies, but include at least one frequency and volume.

    Add a DOM element to change one aspect of your visualization.

    Make it personal. Make it interesting. Imagine how this could be used as visuals for a performance.

    Include in your README information about the song that you picked, and how the song's parameters are contributing to the  visualization.

    ### HW10B

    ### Visualizing Recorded Sound

    This is similar, but different from the previous exercise.

    Like above, we will use the [p5 sound library](https://p5js.org/reference/p5.sound/) to visualize a song, but this time, instead of visualizing the first minute of a song as it plays, we will create a static representation of the whole song.

    Pick a song, any song. It can be the same song as exercise A, as long as it's around $3$ minutes long.

    Load the song into your sketch using the `loadSound()` function, as above, but this time, use [`getPeaks()`](https://archive.p5js.org/reference/#/p5.SoundFile/getPeaks) to get all of the song's samples at once, without playing the song.

    The `getPeaks()` function will return information about the entire song, but the length of the array returned should be $5$ times the width of the canvas. Use **ALL** of these samples to create a static representation of the song.

    Since there are lots of samples to visualize, make the canvas as big as the browser window:
    ```js
    createCanvas(windowWidth, windowHeight);
    ```

    A simple line graph won't be enough. Make it personal. Make it interesting. You can even combine the sample information with text and/or images and other drawings to make a really nice poster or album cover.

    Include in your README information about the song that you picked, and how the song's samples are contributing to the  visualization.

  title: How physical is computing?
  intro: "Keep this question in mind while you read and write a 200-word response to the following:"
  description: |
    As always, your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: in one or two phrases, what are these texts about?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How are the texts related?
    - Did the texts remind you of any other texts we've read so far?
    - How are the texts related to programming?
    - Was there anything in the texts that surprised you? What? Why?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563).

    Alternatively, you may create a `reading.md` file in your `HW10` repo and write your response in markdown. Just make sure to submit a link to the file using [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563).
