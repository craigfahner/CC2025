    This assignment is to guarantee that we all have our tools and accounts setup for the rest of the course. There are 3 mandatory tasks that should be complete:

    1\. Setup a GitHub account. We did this in class, but here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVRuPO8nCLA) refresher. Once you have an account, submit your username or profile link via Brightspace. (2 points)

    2\. Setup a GitHub organization for keeping your class project files. This will help. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnFm5fYGzso) showing how to do it. Submit your organization name or profile link via Brightspace. (2 points)

    3\. Setup your local development environment with VSCode and its plugins (or another IDE) and the GitHub Desktop App. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN5A0kDdCwk) showing how to setup the GitHub Desktop App. Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlyQ9GR1LBM) that shows how to install plugins in VSCode. You should have these installed: [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer), [p5js Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=acidic9.p5js-snippets), [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode). Let me know which IDE you're using and if you are using the GitHub Desktop App (or another git client) via your submission on Brightspace. (5 points)

    4\. Start a repository from the [class template](https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/p5js-template) in your personal or organization GitHub account. It should be named HW01. Enable GitHub pages to make your project go "live". Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDNc-epGz58) showing how to do this. Submit the link to this repo via Brightspace. (3 points)

    This is just like what we did in class, but now it's called `HW01` and it should be in your _organization_'s profile.

    Please submit your answers via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563).

    Example submission:  
    1\. thiagohersan  
    2\. DM-GY-6063-2024F-B  
    3\. VSCode + GitHub Desktop App  
    4\. https://github.com/DM-GY-6063-2024F-B/HW01

  title: Why should we learn to program?
  intro: |
    Keep this question in mind while you read this week's text and write a 200-word response to the text:
  description: |
    Your response should be personal, meaning that you should be expressing your views and opinions about the text and not just summarizing it. You can use the following rubric to guide your response:

    - Short summary: In one or two phrases, what is it about? Who wrote it? When?
    - Did you learn something new? What?
    - What do you agree or disagree with? Why?
    - How is this text related to programming?
    - If you were to continue reading the book which chapter or command do you think would resonate the strongest with you?
    - If you were to look up another thinker/author, were there any references in the text that intrigued you?

    Please submit your response via [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563).

    Grading for the readings will be assigned following these considerations:

    | Response | Grade|
    | --- | --- |
    | Only summarized the reading | 2 points |
    | Answered some of the prompts, but I can't tell whether<br>you actually read the text, or what you thought | 3 points |
    | Answered enough prompts to express opinions | 5 points |
