    You have the week to finish your project, documentation and presentation.

    You should be working on the same repository you submitted for Milestones 01 and 02.

    By the due date you should have your project up and running on a live page hosted on GitHub.

    ### Presentation
    Everyone will have 5 minutes to present their project to the class.

    We have a presentation template [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Q-Ozw4FpOL1EDG5uvs_jgHlSKt7XRRA4BwWCkVenCm0/). Feel free to make your own. Just make sure the following information is included:
    1. Title slide
    2. Plot/themes summary
    3. Aspect of plot/themes explored
    4. Challenges (imagined and real)
    5. Part of the code you're proud of
    6. Link to live page for a short demonstration

    ### Submission
    Include a progress writeup in your README file with:
    - what you've done this week
    - description of the final interactivity or time-based logic
    - images, drawings, sketches

    Please use [Brightspace](https://brightspace.nyu.edu/d2l/home/407563) to submit a link to your project repository, and a link or pdf file of your presentation.

    ### Grading
    The following guide will be used for grading:

    | Task | Points |
    | --- | --- |
    | Presentation | 6 points |
    | Documentation | 6 points |
    | Project is compliant | 6 points |
    | Project is ex-pressive | 6 points |
    | Project is in-pressive | 6 points |

    Presentation: slides, presentation and demo are well organized, easy to follow and compelling.

    Documentation: project has a healthy README with weekly updates, sketches, images, references and progress reports.

    Compliant: project followed the requirements: it's interactive or time-based, it includes custom functions, arrays, objects, `for()` loops and `if()` statements.

    Ex-pressive: project demonstrates your personality. It makes connections between course content, the rest of the world and your own interests as an artist, designer, technologist. 

    In-pressive: project was challenging, demonstrates growth and shows mastery of programming concepts.
