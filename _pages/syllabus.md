## Course Overview and Goals

This is an introductory programming course that emphasizes the creative possibilities of code. Unlike a typical software engineering course, this course is a hands-on studio that challenges students to go beyond linear thinking around algorithms. We will examine and discuss code-based art and design and write and iterate code-based projects through creative experimentation. By the end of the course, students will be empowered to interpret and create code-based artworks including: interactive installations, gestural interfaces, generative visualizations, experimental games, A/V experiences and more.

### Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:

- Understand and apply the basics of coding in JavaScript and p5.js
- Create code-based artworks that creatively engage with the possibilities of p5.js and other creative coding tools
- Learn best practices for designing software within an event-driven, object-oriented, real-time framework
- Experiment with different techniques for user input and output
- Develop an awareness of historical and contemporary artistic practices that use interactive technology and code
- Propose and develop a complete software experience as a final project

## Course Requirements

### Class Participation and Code Review

Class participation counts towards your grade. You are invited, encouraged, and expected to engage actively in discussion, activities and student presentations. The classroom will be established as a comfortable and respectful environment for discussion. You are encouraged to seek and provide help from your peers whenever possible.

Each student’s participation grade will start at 15/15. Each week, one to three students will be selected randomly for Code Review, in which you will walk through the code you wrote to create your assignment. This serves two purposes: for one, it allows students the opportunity to showcase their work for the class. It also serves as a countermeasure to plagiarism and inappropriate use of LLMs. If you have written your code yourself, you should have no problem at all walking through your process. Sufficient description of your process will result in no penalty, while inability to walk the class through your code will result in a penalty of 10 points.

Additionally, the participation grade will decrease by 1 each time the student arrives late, and if the student is observed engaging in distracting, unprepared or disengaged conduct during class time.

### GitHub Portfolio

Each week a coding exercise will be assigned that relates to the week’s technical topic. Many of these exercises are iterative and will be expanded upon each week. Each stage of iteration must be documented in your GitHub repository. You can think of these as your notes from class lectures. Weekly exercises are due before class at the beginning of each week in a corresponding folder in the student’s GitHub repo. Late exercises are not accepted. It is much better to turn in a *finished* exercise than a perfect exercise. Exercises are graded on completion It is important that you keep up with the weekly schedule as *things move quickly in this class*. 

### Unit Assignments

Unit assignments expand on in-class coding exercises, inviting students to creatively engage with programming concepts. Unit assignments are graded equally in terms of creative engagement and technical proficiency. As such, students are encouraged to create work that reflects their own aesthetic and conceptual interests in these assignments. A detailed description of each assignment will be distributed on the class GitHub site. Students will upload their assignments to GitHub, and will share a URL to their project to Brightspace where feedback will be provided by the instructor.

**Due dates:**
- Geometric Abstraction (due September 24 - 10%)
- Generative Pattern (due October 1 - 10%)
- Abstract Clock (due October 8 - 10%)
- Object factory (due October 22- 10%)
- Projection mapping (due October 29 - 10%)	50%

### Final Project

The final project invites students to expand on one or more aspects of the course in greater depth. There are three suggested formats / conceptual frameworks that I encourage you to explore for your final project:
- **MIRROR**: create an interactive experience that reflects something back to the user. This shouldn’t behave as a typical visual mirror, but should modify the user’s image or gesture into an unexpected output.
- **INSTRUMENT**: expanding on the instrumentation exercises from class, create an instrument that transforms a gesture into some form of audio/visual expression. This does not have to be a typical musical instrument. Experimentation with different generative and interactive possibilities is encouraged!
- **CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE**: create an interactive narrative that invites the user to make choices that influence their journey. This narrative should make use of dynamic user input and should include sound and visual forms.
Students are also encouraged to bring their own formats and ideas to the table – I am open to all kinds of project ideas, so long as they demonstrate several technical approaches from the course and are feasible within the given time frame. Students will be asked to turn in a project proposal mid-semester that outlines their ideas for the final project. 

Final project proposal (due November 12 - 5%)
Final Project presentation (due December 15 – 20%)	20%
