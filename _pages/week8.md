## For next class...

- Complete Assignment 5 (create 3 mini-sketches to prepare for projection mapping workshop)
- Buy an Arduino!
- Next class we meet in the 2nd Floor Ballroom space (rooms 221-224) for the projection mapping workshop



## Arduino info

For this class (and your other IDM classes) you will need the following as a minimum:

- [Arduino Nano ESP32 with headers](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32-with-headers?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=b5a3c848f&pr_rec_pid=7222098591951&pr_ref_pid=7222103965903&pr_seq=uniform)
- [a full-size breadboard](https://www.pishop.us/product/full-sized-breadboard-830-points/) or [half-size breadboard](https://www.pishop.us/product/half-size-400-pin-diy-breadboard-clear/?searchid=0&search_query=breadboard)
    - alternate links: [half](https://www.amazon.com/Qunqi-point-Experiment-Breadboard-5-5%C3%978-2%C3%970-85cm/dp/B0135IQ0ZC) or [full](amazon.com/California-JOS-Breadboard-Solderless-Distribution/dp/B0BRQX6G3T)
- An appropriate USB cable

You may use any of the following sites to buy your Arduino:
- [Arduino Store](https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/nano-esp32-with-headers?pr_prod_strat=e5_desc&pr_rec_id=b5a3c848f&pr_rec_pid=7222098591951&pr_ref_pid=7222103965903&pr_seq=uniform)
- [PiShop](https://www.pishop.us/product/arduino-nano-esp32-with-headers/?srsltid=AfmBOoquptfj2C0CD75JkodmGGsX782v2FgG-tg7_OH9riLi7yGoxIGGPmQ)
- [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-ABX00083-Bluetooth-MicroPython-Compatible/dp/B0C947BHK5?th=1)

- I strongly recommend getting a kit that includes a breadboard and other components:
    - [Kit 1](https://www.amazon.com/DIYables-Starter-Arduino-ESP8266-Raspberry/dp/B0C27K6GDZ)
    - [Kit 2](https://www.amazon.com/16Hertz-Electronics-Breadboard-Resistors-Raspberry/dp/B00J4RN61A/ref=sims_dp_d_dex_popular_subs_t3_v6_d_sccl_1_3/143-6369338-4295529?pd_rd_w=hGMwD&content-id=amzn1.sym.b853d215-90db-49b5-bd69-9909dc4557b0&pf_rd_p=b853d215-90db-49b5-bd69-9909dc4557b0&pf_rd_r=KY74R6BVKVBZCRHWXK2S&pd_rd_wg=PnV2J&pd_rd_r=24618633-8fd4-441a-8013-145060260057&pd_rd_i=B00J4RN61A&psc=1)
    - [Kit 3](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07Z1BK7NG/ref=sspa_dk_detail_0?psc=1&pf_rd_p=8c2f9165-8e93-42a1-8313-73d3809141a2&pf_rd_r=KBWMCZTKTFBYNXH90X6Q&pd_rd_wg=gsNQX&pd_rd_w=g9fUv&content-id=amzn1.sym.8c2f9165-8e93-42a1-8313-73d3809141a2&pd_rd_r=815789a6-3e5f-4478-8bf7-594f42d0e20d&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9kZXRhaWw)

Alternatively, there are components in the Design Lab that can be used for this class. Please have your Arduinos arrive before the November 5th class.
